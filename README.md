Weather data conditions affect the speed at which planes arrive and depart from
airports, so our task was predicting the radar elements to understand
the cloud movement that can be used to determine arrival rate of planes landing at airports.
Linear Regression model was used to understand the correlation between these radar
elements. A model that essentially considers historical data and looks at cloud
movement and placement under specified parameters was also designed using LSTM model
to determine the correctness of the system.
